🚢 Titanic Survival Prediction  

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project predicts passenger survival on the Titanic using a **Random Forest** model. The dataset, sourced from **Kaggle**, contains passenger details such as age, gender, and ticket class. The goal is to analyze these features and determine the probability of survival.  

## 📊 Dataset  
- **Source:** [Kaggle Titanic Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data)  
- **Features Used:**  
  - `Pclass` (Ticket class)  
  - `Sex` (Gender)  
  - `Age`  
  - `PassengerId`
  - `survived`

## 🛠️ Technologies Used  
- **Python**  
- **Pandas, NumPy** (Data processing)  
- **Scikit-learn** (Machine Learning)  
- **Matplotlib, Seaborn** (Data visualization)  
- **Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab**  

📈 Model Performance
Model Used: Random Forest Classifier
Evaluation Metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score
Feature Importance Analysis Included

🏆 Results
The Random Forest model achieves [78%]( @url) accuracy on the test dataset. Feature importance analysis shows that gender and ticket class are the most influential survival factors.
